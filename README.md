# Python template

Very much a WIP.

## Features:

- Envrc
- pdm
- tox
- multiple linters with prospector
- easy to use, old school, makefile
- Multi-step, effcient and [best-practice compliant](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images) docker file

## Purpose:

Ready to be cannibalized and re-used in other projects. Should never start coding from this as it is.
